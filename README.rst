An Interactive Introduction to MATLAB

About the course
================

This course was originally developed in the `School of Engineering <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk>`_ at `The University of Edinburgh <http://www.ed.ac.uk>`_ to provide appropriate material for teaching MATLAB in all engineering disciplines as well as to a wider audience. It is a self-study, self-paced course that emphasises responsible learning. The course material consists of this document used in conjunction with a series of `video screencasts <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlE-GBjzmBZsxFKZfp6Y59qDOJVIh4RN>`_ that are hosted on the School of Engineering YouTube channel.

Who should use this document?
-----------------------------

This document is targeted at those with no prior knowledge of MATLAB, and no previous programming experience. The aim, upon completion of the course, is to be competent using the most common features in MATLAB and be able to apply them to solve engineering problems.

What is in this document?
-------------------------

This document forms part of a self-study course to help you get started with MATLAB. It should be used along with the supporting `video screencasts <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlE-GBjzmBZsxFKZfp6Y59qDOJVIh4RN>`_ and any additional material that maybe hosted on your institutions virtual learning environment. The main body of this document contains the fundamental topics for the course and there are also several more advanced topics given in appendices.

How do I use this document?
---------------------------

This document contains different elements designed to make your learning experience as smooth as possible. To benefit the most from these elements you are encouraged to use the online PDF version of this document. One of the first things you’ll notice is that this document contains many links: those in red indicate a link to online material, and those in blue indicate a link to another section of this document.
A key part of this course are the screencasts, which are `video screen captures <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast>`_. In this document screencasts are indicated by a link in a blue box with a clapperboard icon. Clicking on a link to a screencast will take you to the YouTube video where you will see the opening image to a University of Edinburgh screencast presented in the video player. Watching and learning from the screencasts are an essential part of the course and will help you develop your skills in MATLAB more quickly.

You will also notice two other types of blue box environments in this document: one is for Hints and Tips (with a question mark icon), and the other contains exercises that you should complete
(with an inkwell icon).

Additionally there are grey box environments in this document. These contain code listings that demonstrate actual MATLAB code. Line numbers are given to the left of the listings to make is simpler to refer to specific
bits of code. Very often you will be required to copy and paste the listing into MATLAB and try running it for yourself.

Sources of help and further reading
-----------------------------------

There are a huge number of textbooks published on the subject of MATLAB! A user-friendly textbook that provides a good introduction to MATLAB is:

* Gilat, A. (2008). MATLAB: An Introduction With Applications. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 3rd edition.

There are a couple of further textbooks listed in the Bibliography section at the end of this document. However, throughout this course and beyond, the most important source of help is the documentation built-in to MATLAB. It is easily searchable, and because MATLAB contains many built-in functions it is worth checking out before starting to write your own code.

* `MATLAB help documentation <http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/>`_ Accessed through the help menu in MATLAB, or online.
* `MATLAB Central <http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/>`_ An open exchange for users, with code snippets, help forums and blogs. A great place to search for specific help!

Development of this course
--------------------------

The development of this course was funded through The Edinburgh Fund Small Project Grant which is part of `The University of Edinburgh Campaign <http://www.edinburghcampaign.com/alumni-giving/grants>`_.
The material for this course was developed by `Prof. Tina Düren <http://www.bath.ac.uk/chem-eng/people/duren/>`_, `Dr. Antonis Giannopoulos <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-antonis-giannopoulos>`_, `Prof. Guillermo Rein <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.rein>`_, `Prof. John Thompson <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-john-thompson>`_, and `Dr. Craig Warren <https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/w/craig-warren/>`_. The original screencasts were created by Dr. Craig Warren. Revised  screencasts (to reflect an update to the MATLAB User Interface - MATLAB R2013a) were made by Joe Burchell.
